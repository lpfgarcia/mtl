'Now if you want to hear some boogie like I\'m gonna play  
It\'s just an old piano and a knockout bass  
The drummer\'s man\'s a cat they call Charlie McCoy  
You know, remember that rubber legged boy?  
Mama cookin\' chicken fried and bacon grease  
Come on along boys it\'s just down the road apiece  
  
Well there\'s a place you really get your kicks  
It\'s open every night about twelve to six  
Now if you want to hear some boogie you can get your fill  
And shove and sting like an old steam drill  
Come on along you can lose your lead  
Down the road, down the road, down the road apiece

'Did you ever feel the pain  
That he felt upon the cross  
Did you ever feel the knife  
Tearing flesh that\'s oh so soft  
  
Did you ever touch the night  
Did you ever count the cost  
Do you hide away the fear  
Put down paradise as lost  
  
Yeah you\'re blinded by rainbows  
Watching the wind blow  
Blinded by rainbows  
Do you dream at night  
Do you sleep at night  
I doubt it

As the semtex bomb goes off  
Do you ever hear the screams  
As the limbs are all torn off  
Did you ever kiss the child  
Who just saw his father shot  
Do you ever shed a tear  
As the war drags on and on  
  
Do you ever touch the night  
Or is it just another job  
Do you feel the final hours  
Put down paradise as lost  
  
Yeah you\'re blinded by rainbows

Blinded by rainbows  
Do you dream at night  
Do you sleep at night

Could it be the war is lost  
Do you fear the final hour  
Do you kneel before the cross  
  
You\'re blinded by rainbows

Blinded by rainbows  
Do you dream at night  
Do you scream at night  
Do you smell of fear  
Is your conscience clear  
Are you caked in sweat  
  
Are your clothes all wet  
Do you see the light  
Is the end in sight  
See the face of Christ  
Enter paradise

To see what the colours of death are all about

That he can\'t play his guitar like E.G. Jim  
Or write St. Augustine if he tried

I crash landed in a Louisiana swamp  
Shot up a horde of zombies

It just reflects my mood  
  
Sitting in the dirt  
Feeling kind of hurt  
Aaaaall I hear is doooom and gloom  
And aaaaall is darkness in my room  
Through the light your face I see  
Baby take a chance  
Baby won\'t you dance with meeeeee  
  
Lost all that treasure in an overseas war  
It just goes to show you don\'t get what you paid for  
Battle to the rich and you worry about the poor  
Put my feet up on the couch  
And lock all the doors  
Hear a funky noise  
That\'s the tightening of the screeeeews  
  
I\'m feeling kind of hurt  
Sitting in the dirt  
Aaaaall I hear is doooom and gloom  
But when those drums go boom boom boom  
Through the night your face I see  
Baby take a chance  
Baby won\'t you dance with meeee  
Yeah  
Baby won\'t you dance with meeee  
Oh yeah

There\'s kids all picking  
Ar the garbage dumb

So I better prime the pump  
I\'m trying to stay sober  
But I end up drunk  
  
We\'ll be eating dirt  
Living on the side of the roooaaad  
There\'s some food for thought  
Kind of makes your head explode  
Feeling kind of hurt  
Yeah  
  
But aaaall I hear is doooom and gloom  
And aaaaall is darkness in my room  
Through the night your face I see  
Baby come on  
Baby won\'t you dance with me

'We all came out to Montreux  
On the Lake Geneva shoreline  
To make records with a mobile  
We didn\'t have much time  
Frank Zappa and the Mothers  
Were at the best place around  
But some stupid with a flare gun  
Burned the place to the ground  
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky  
  
They burned down the gambling house  
It died with an awful sound  
Funky Claude was running in and out  
Pulling kids out the ground  
When it all was over  
We had to find another place  
But Swiss time was running out  
It seemed that we would lose the race  
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky  
  
We ended up at the grand hotel  
It was empty cold and bare  
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside  
Making our music there  
With a few red lights and a few old beds  
We make a place to sweat  
No matter what we get out of this  
I know we\'ll never forget  
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

It says, "One day, this may find you,  
These few words may just remind you.  
We sat here together just to pass time,  
You said how the coffee tasted so fine. "

Up the revolution we\'re all prepared to die  
Up the revolution that was the battle cry  
  
There\'s gonna be Hell, Hell to pay  
There\'s gonna be Hell, Hell to pay  
  
Annie was a die-hard rebel in the good old days of way back when  
The cigarette was cool and all the kids in school could read and count to ten  
Annie once said he had a few to bribe of that there was no doubt  
He never could make us understand what the rebellion was all about  
  
Up the revolution we\'re all prepared to die  
Up the revolution that was the battle cry  
  
There\'s gonna be Hell, yeah, Hell to pay  
There\'s gonna be Hell, Hell to pay  
  
Two-tone Annie drew up battle plans for making love not war  
Everybody laughed at the fighting in the streets and behind the garden door  
It came to nothing when it all went down and the band began to play  
Another plan put your head in the sand live to fight another day  
  
Up the revolution we\'re all prepared to die  
Up the revolution that was the battle cry  
  
There\'s gonna be Hell, Hell to pay  
There\'s gonna be Hell, Hell to pay  
There\'s gonna be Hell, Hell to pay  
There\'s gonna be Hell

'Maybe it\'s because I\'m only starting  
That I think it won\'t take too long  
Maybe it\'s because I can see you laughing  
That I think you\'ve got it wrong  
Maybe I could be like Robin Hood  
Like and outlaw dressed all in green  
Someone said what\'s he gonna turn out like  
And someone else said never mind  
Well I was big and bold and more than twice as old  
As all the cats I\'d ever seen  
I grew my hair and bought a suit  
Of shiny white or was it cream  
I shook and shivered danced and quivered  
And stood on a mountain top  
  
No one came from miles around and said  
Man your music is really hot  
  
Well I knew what they meant because I was a freak  
My throat was tired and worn  
My pretty face just looked out of place  
As they poured on the scorn  
I wrote on yellow paper from a man who was the king  
He said my boy we\'ll have some crazy scenes  
There weren\'t any scenes at all like he was talkin\' about  
He must\'ve been the king of queens  
Well I could write a million songs about the things I\'ve done  
But I could never sing them so they\'d never get sung  
There\'s a law for the rich and one for the poor  
And there\'s another one for sing  
It\'s die young and live much longer  
Spend your money and sit and wonder  
  
No one came for miles around  
And said man your music is really funky  
  
I believe that I must tell the truth  
And say things as they really are  
But if I told the truth and nothing but the truth  
Could I ever be a star  
Nobody knows who\'s real and who\'s fakin\'  
Everyone\'s shouting out loud  
It\'s only the glitter and shine that gets through  
Where\'s my Robin Hood outfit  
Well I\'ve come and I\'ve gone before you wink an eye  
No one ever cared enough to say goodbye  
The money\'s good and the time you have  
Fun and games galore  
But you spend your money and lie in bed forgotten  
And you wonder what you did it for  
  
No one came from miles around  
And said man who\'s he?

You say you\'re feelin\' fine

The mood is set alright

'Mama plays a queen on the hill built on a dream  
While the children play in the field  
Papa smokes the pipe of a sweet and better life  
But how strong is the shield?  
Can peace be found on the carpet above ground  
Where sky is forever blue  
  
So let it pass baby now, the slow and riding cloud  
Which may take me from you  
  
Many things a man can lose  
His self, his rights, his views  
But never his heart or his love  
So take this hand of mine and climb baby, climb  
To the hill up above  
  
Now you can play a queen on the hill built on a dream  
While our children play in the field  
I can smoke the pipe of a sweet and better life  
And trust in the strength of the shield  
  
So trust in you love, and Lucy of above  
And let light pass like a wheel  
Don\'t take the chance of life\'s hectic dance  
Kiss the strength of the shield  
  
The seeker will be found by the looker on the ground  
And to his wish he will yield  
  
Fate will have it\'s word, of course  
(Think this line is wrong)  
And time will change its course  
And hold the strength of the shield

Lookin\' down a forty-four in West Virginia  
  
I was dancin\', dancin\', dancin\' so free  
Dancin\', dancin\', dancin\' so free  
Dancin\', Lord, keep your hand off me  
Dancin\' with Mr. D., with Mr. D., with Mr. D.  
  
One night I was dancin\' with a lady in black  
Wearin\' black silk gloves and a black silk hat  
She looked at me longin\' with black velvet eyes  
She gazed at me strange all cunning and wise  
Then I saw the flesh just fall off her bones  
The eyes in her skull was burning like coals  
Lord, have mercy, fire and brimstone  
I was dancin\' with Mrs. D.  
  
Lord, I was dancin\', dancin\', dancin\' so free  
I was dancin\', dancin\', dancin\' so free  
Dancin\', dancin\', dancin\' so free

Used to find, and it was, in your mind, yeah  
  
I got red blood, and I got blood red wine  
Which I bring you, when the snow is heavy on the ground  
If you say where go I\'ll just, wrap my cloak around  
  
You say that every man you ever had  
Has been obsessed with you and I, wanna prove an exception  
To the rule, that you lay down  
Babe, please don\'t make me cry, \'cause there\'s a little pain inside  
Yes my darling now you can\'t expect me always to hide  
  
I got red blood, and I got, blood red wine  
Which I bring you when the snow lies heavy on the ground  
If you say we\'ll go, why-ow...  
Let me, let me, wrap my coat around  
  
Yeah, that\'s right  
You see that every time well the lines must rhyme  
And every verse, be in the same old time  
Does it all, have to rhyme?  
But there go, and that\'s a place that you will never...  
You said to remind of the girl I used to know, and used to love, yeah

'Playing pool and drinking beer  
Nothin\' more\'n the  
Occasional tear  
But this man\'s life goes on  
And he gets  
Greased all over  
From time to time  
At the strip joint, where we met  
He said \'Hi, my name is Ted  
See that one over there  
That ball of thunder  
Every time she goes Vavoom,  
I wiggle in my chair  
Can I buy you a beer?  
What a guy  
  
I\'ve had a few myself he said  
But I never quit when I\'m ahead  
Too many rules and regulations  
Stupid laws designed by fools behind closed doors  
And another thing I won\'t discuss is religion  
It always causes a fight  
Vavoom  
There she goes again  
\'How does she do that\' said Ted  
  
And he told me  
Of those unjustices (that)  
He had suffered in his life  
His wife and kids  
And boss and dogs  
And neighbors  
Raising cain and causing strife  
They were forever whining  
Bleating howling yapping screeching moaning crying  
Vavoom  
He fed them well  
He keep them warm  
  
Thing about Ted  
He didn\'t really care  
Nothing much got in his hair  
And the beauty of it was  
That he was right  
He was big as a truck  
And fast as a door  
(what\'s that?)  
He was always right  
  
The banjo player took a hike  
What\'s that song  
I used to like  
Vavoom  
He was big as a truck  
Fast as a door - Ted

A fanfare wakes the land  
The naked lives just a shining down  
At the dawn of the common man  
  
Outside in the madding crowd  
He laughs along the way  
Traffic city, what a pity  
It doesn\'t have a word to say  
  
Troubled people, billions of people  
They can\'t seem to understand  
The ringing ears are unable to hear  
The sounds of the natural plan  
  
Yeah yeah yeah

You gotta shoot your gun - don\'t expect me to dance  
Hold me up to the spotlight but  
Don\'t, don\'t hold your breath  
Don\'t hold your breath  
Don\'t hold your breath  
Don\'t hold your breath

Full of nothing but good intentions

I\'ll be all right tomorrow but

To sing before the queen

She wouldn\'t see the show  
  
What a fright

Oh what a night

All about the sk  
With memories of a clown  
The saddest show in town

Be careful what you touch  
You shouldn\'t take so much

I could have cried  
  
In my mind

Of being oh so cool  
Like a blue blooded  
Well studded  
English fool

Times are changing fast  
Once I was so weak  
I couldn\'t even speak

Nothing could be worse  
Walking through the door  
Who could ask for more

Hey! You! Get off of my cloud  
Hey! You! Get off of my cloud  
Don\'t hang around \'cause two\'s a crowd  
On my cloud, baby  
  
The telephone is ringing  
I say, "Hi, it\'s me. Who is there on the line?"  
A voice says, "Hi, hello, how are you?"  
Well, I guess I\'m doin\' fine  
He says, "It\'s three a.m., there\'s too much noise  
Don\'t you people ever want to go to bed?  
Just \'cause you feel so good,  
Do you have to drive me out of my head ?"

I was sick and tired, fed up with this  
And decided to take a drive downtown  
It was so very quiet and peaceful  
There was nobody, not a soul around  
I laid myself out, I was so tired  
And I started to dream  
In the morning the parking tickets were just - like a flag stuck on my window
screen

Looked like they\'d get blown out of the water  
They did of course eventually come ashore  
As meek as mice or to be more accurate  
As lambs to the slaughter

We can speak about Bananas for one second  
Just because I understand  
You have to get them off your chest

Could you do some more of these here ID\'s  
And then this station might maintain some interest

Of dizzy heights  
Its what they want you know  
Oh well here I go  
  
What a funny show  
  
Take my time, it\'s the odds that count  
Who am I? What a silly sound  
Hold my breath, talk of sudden death  
Rhyme and reason must prevail  
I need a glass of ale  
  
I\'ve gotta feeling now  
No need for me to tell you how  
It\'s really kind of easy now  
Woa, like rock n\' roll

It\'s funky and it\'s outta sight  
Feeling good, feeling right  
It\'s gonna be alright

Hear me grieving, I\'m lying on the floor.  
Whether I\'m drunk or dead I really ain\'t too sure.  
  
I\'m a blind man, I\'m a blind man and my world is pale.  
When a blind man cries, Lord, you know there ain\'t no sadder tale.  
  
Had a friend once in a room,  
had a good time but it ended much too soon.  
In a cold month in that room  
we found a reason for the things we had to do.  
  
I\'m a blind man, I\'m a blind man, now my room is cold.  
When a blind man cries, Lord, you know he feels it from his soul.

I may be slow but I never quit  
Sometimes on a good day I sit and think  
Sometimes I just sit

\'Cause she is so smart, she\'s a hell of a catch"

Drifting for months on a billowing cloud  
But after awhile I stopped to rebel

I acted impatient, I acted unkind  
I took her for granted, I played with her mind  
She didn\'t deserve it but it was too late  
I walked out the door and left her to her fate  
  
But I think I\'ve just made the biggest mistake of my life  
And I think I\'ve just made the biggest mistake of my life

Capitulation watch the mighty fall  
The road to glory is lined in red  
And though the reason now is gone  
The battle rages on  
  
Was it love or hate that got here first?  
Hate\'s a habit, it\'s hard to shake the curse  
Kill to live, and live to die  
Human nature you let the strong survive  
  
Oh don\'t talk to me of love  
Be serious, it\'s not enough  
Annihilation kill \'em all  
Capitulation watch the mighty fall  
The road to glory is lined in red  
And though the reason now is gone  
The battle rages on

'Unforgettable face  
I can\'t think of her name  
It\'s on the edge of my tongue  
Gathering dust in the  
Back of my brain  
Something \'bout the way  
She ignores me  
That\'s vaguely familiar  
Makes you wonder what it was  
You ever did to thrill her  
  
Here we go again  
Here we go again  
Here I go again  
  
I never felt the need to soothe  
Her savage breast  
She never felt obliged to tell me  
Of her change of address  
Caught me on a downward swing  
But I fell through her arms  
How could I be so careless  
I never meant to go so far  
  
Here we go again  
Here we go again  
Here I go again  
  
Oh she\'s back in town  
Oh she\'s back in town  
I\'m not leaving I\'m running away  
  
She took it all away  
Now she\'s back for the rest  
Took it all so easy  
Wouldn\'t settle for less  
She doesn\'t know what  
She wants  
But she knows how to get it  
I can\'t remember the time  
She never let me forget it

Dress the part\'

But they always get depleted by the cavalry

It\'s guaranteed  
Just send a donation straight to God  
1-800 toll free

Where am I going what am I doing here  
But strangeways is all I got  
  
Have you seen the headlines  
Princess engaged  
3 million out of work  
But that\'s on the 2nd page  
The alien has landed  
Finger in his ear  
Can\'t hear a word I am saying

Coming down again, coming down again  
Where are all my friends, coming down again  
  
Coming down again, coming down again  
On the ground again, coming down again  
  
Slipped my tongue in someone else\'s pie  
Tasting better ev\'ry time  
She turned green and tried to make me cry  
Being hungry it ain\'t no crime  
  
Coming down again, coming down again  
All my time\'s been spent, coming down again

Over the world, scratching on the ground  
Looking for the peace that nobody has found  
  
I am a spokesman for a better way of living  
Love is the word and it can be heard  
If you are young the message can be sung  
  
Let me hear you sing,  
Hallelujah  
  
Oh, tell it to the man who\'s power is the sermon on the wall  
Tell it to the man who says you can misjudge them all  
Tell it \'till it can be heard above the wailing of the crowd  
Tell it on the field of war and hope you\'ll soon be justified  
  
There is a better way of life and it\'s not so hard to find  
If you live and let the people in your world speak it\'s mind  
  
I am the pupil who sells his life for freedom  
All over the world and it can be heard  
If you are young the message can be sung

Tuning up to madness in the back room  
Candles burning  
Present the Stinking Hippy and throw the  
Naked thunder to the crowd  
In the Hungry Daze

It\'s going nowhere  
Sickness and disease and mad  
Corruption

In hungry daze  
  
Along the Mountain Road to do some  
Drinking  
And now we\'re mobile again  
Different girls, laughing girls, forever  
Girls  
And it\'s so loud  
The crew have lost again  
They are beaten men  
The winning team united  
Living for the crowd  
These are the hungry daze

Policemen\'s buttons clean  
You\'re the man who squats behind the man  
Who works the soft machine

Laughing in my grave

'You can follow the road to the mountain  
Or the track leading down to the beach  
You can go where your life go left or go right  
It\'s you in the driver\'s seat  
  
But if the rain starts swamping your windscreen  
And the lights don\'t piss through the night  
And the truck\'s coming at you, just going to splash you  
The highway\'s blinding bright  
  
You\'re going out of your brain, out of your mind  
You\'re so deranged, you\'re going blind  
  
You\'re driving too fast  
You went straight past the curve and you never go back  
Driving too fast  
The road was a blur and it all turned to black  
Driving too fast  
Hang on to the wheel, I think you\'re going to crash  
  
You can see the freeway divided  
It\'s a pity you can\'t take \'em both  
One leads to the valley or down some blind alley  
The other runs down to the coast  
  
Too many roads lead to nowhere  
But how they twist and they turn  
And a dead end and a dusty old strip mall  
Where your tires are all shredded and burned  
  
You\'re going out of your brain, out of your mind  
Going insane, you\'re going blind, yeah  
  
You\'re driving too fast  
You slip through the curve and your slam through the flat  
Driving too fast  
Now you never go back  
  
Driving too fast  
Yeah and it\'s all time to pass, yeah  
You\'re driving too fast  
Hang on for your life, I think you\'re going to crash

Driving too fast  
You spin through the curve and you burn off the track

Driving too fast

'Chasing shadows, over my walls  
with myself hardly sleeping  
Dwarfs and giants, twenty feet tall  
fill the room with their creeping  
  
Sounds of breathing sharpen my ears  
then they fade into nothing  
Someone\'s laughter out in the street  
fills the night with their loving  
  
I feel the ice in my head  
Running its hands through my bed  
Not even dreaming I seem to be dead  
Colours of yellow and colours of red  
  
All I\'m asking some secret voice  
Is to lead me to darkness  
  
I\'m so tired, dawn never comes  
I just hide in the shadows

Oh I can\'t get through and I\'m falling  
I\'m getting out, I\'m losing ground  
The Spanish archer\'s gonna bring you down  
  
is there someone somewhere waiting in the wings  
to take my place  
Let\'s not drag it out like a Cagney death scene  
In this season of change it\'s not hard to explain  
Like the leaves on the trees I\'m falling  
And as you turn, don\'t look away  
The Spanish archer\'s gonna make you pay  
  
Do you remember when the sky was blue  
we used to talk for miles  
And now we drive along in this thundering silence  
It\'s such an obvious lie with that easy smile of yours  
I\'m letting go and I\'m falling  
I\'m getting out, losing ground  
The Spanish archer\'s gonna bring you down  
  
Well is there something I can say as we stumble to the edge have we gone too
far  
Why don\'t we call it a day before we call it a nightmare darlin\'  
If we made a mistake then all that it takes to be free  
Is the wave of a hand and you\'re falling  
And as you turn, don\'t look away  
The Spanish archer\'s gonna make you pay

'Broken down relations, beaten up guitars  
Making one last appearance in a heap of old cars  
Brambles and weeds flourishing amongst  
Lines of empty bottles and rambling drunks  
  
Junkyard blues sounds familiar  
I\'m never alone  
Always remind me of home  
  
Once of a dozen covered with stains  
Blistered and stinking was all that remained  
Cannibalized machines, mysterious bones  
Unwanted contents of anonymous homes  
  
Those junkyard blues sounds familiar  
Take me back  
Always remind me of home  
  
Mangy old dog scratching in the dust  
Burned out Mercedes surrendering to rust  
All this stuff was good for something  
But here it is now, good for nothing

I got no reason to be down at the station  
I got no ticket, but I\'m gonna take a fucking ride  
Don\'t care where I go  
I never seem to know  
I never had a penny, but I never wondered why  
Oh no, I never wondered why  
  
If I\'m cold I need some heat  
If I\'m hungry then I eat  
I\'m not responsible  
  
I woke up this morning and I couldn\'t find my shoes  
It\'s one long party and I haven\'t seen the sun for days  
I\'d take you out tonight, but I\'m just a little light  
So let\'s go out anyway, you\'ll be amazed  
  
I take my woman to the palace dancing  
I never coulda made it but the doorman is a friend of mine  
So I raise a glass to you, the foot is on the other shoe  
You can pay the bill and while you\'re at it pick up mine  
Oh, no no, I don\'t mind

If I\'m scared I run and hide  
I\'m not responsible, oh no

No time to think about it even once or twice  
No second chances looking down the road  
When there\'s the only way, only way to go  
  
Oh it makes me wonder  
What\'s going on inside my head  
Well could it be the pressure that I\'m under  
Makes me forget the things I never said  
  
I can\'t remember, I can\'t forget  
Take it from me there\'s not a moment of regret  
Since the day I learned to tie my shoes  
I found it hard to spread the news  
  
Oh it makes me wonder  
What\'s going on inside my head  
Well could it be the pressure that I\'m under  
Makes me forget the things I never said  
  
It\'s hard to swallow, it\'s hard to take  
When I think about it now my knees begin to shake  
Never came to me to mention at the time  
Tell the truth it never crossed my mind  
  
Oh it makes me wonder  
What\'s going on inside my head  
Well could it be the pressure that I\'m under  
Makes me forget the things I never said  
  
Oh it makes me wonder  
What\'s going on inside my head  
Could it be the pressure that I\'m under

Oh, my love is  
So excited  
When I say we\'ve  
Been invited  
Now we\'re going  
To the palace  
Dressing up for  
Tea with Alice  
  
Some will rise and some will fall  
Some will come to nothing at all  
  
The strangest people have the power  
To lead me to my darkest hour  
  
How can you be sure it\'s me  
When it\'s payment on delivery  
  
Oh, my love is  
So excited  
When I say we\'ve  
Been invited  
  
Now we\'re going  
To the palace  
Dressing up for  
Tea with Alice

Richer than rich  
\'Cause I studied  
Mathematics  
  
Graduated  
Without honors  
Everyone has  
Gone Bananas

Take my hand and brush my brow

About the way  
I lived the life of a drifter  
Waiting for the day  
When I\'d take your hand and sing you songs  
Then maybe you would say  
Come lay with me and love me  
And I would surely stay  
  
But I feel I\'m growing older  
And the songs that I have sung  
Echo in the distance  
Like the sound  
Of a windmill going round  
Guess I\'ll always be  
A soldier of fortune.  
  
Many times I\'ve been a traveler  
I looked for something new  
In days of old when nights were cold  
I wandered without you  
But those days I thought my eyes  
Had seen you standing near  
Though blindness is confusing  
It shows that you\'re not here.  
  
Now I feel I\'m going older  
And the songs that I have sung  
Echo in the distance  
Like the sound  
Of a windmill going round  
Guess I\'ll always be  
A soldier of fortune

Of a windmill going round

'Mary Long is a hypocrite  
She does all the things that she tells us not to do  
Selling filth from a corner shop  
And knitting patterns to the high street queue  
She paints roses, even makes them smell good  
And then she draws titties on the khazy wall  
Drowns kittens just to get a thrill  
And writes sermons in the Sunday Chronicle  
  
How did you lose your virginity, Mary Long?  
When will you lose your stupidity, Mary Long?  
  
Mary told Johnny not to write such trash  
Said it was a waste of public money  
She made a fuss, they made apologies  
But everybody thought the show was funny  
When the nation knew you\'d had children  
It came as such a surprise  
We really didn\'t know you\'d had it in you  
How you did it we can only surmise  
  
How did you lose your virginity, Mary Long?  
When will you lose your stupidity, Mary Long?  
  
Mary Long, you\'re not alone  
But you\'re a long way behind our times  
What we do in full frontal view  
Is more honest than your clean-up mind  
What I\'m saying, Mary Long is  
When you can spare a minute  
Go find your friend the porny Lord  
Dig your self a hole and jump in it  
  
How did you lose your virginity, Mary Long?  
When will you lose your stupidity, Mary Long?

I\'ve seen your face before tonight  
Maybe I just see what I want it to be

Do you remember me on a street of dreams?  
Running through my memory on the street of dreams  
  
There you stood, a distant memory  
So good, like we never parted  
Said to myself, I knew you\'d set me free  
And here we are right back where we started  
  
Something\'s come over me and I don\'t know what to feel  
Maybe this fantasy is real  
Now I\'m gonna see what I want it to be  
But it\'s still a mystery  
  
Do you remember me on the street of dreams?  
Running through my memory on the street of dreams

Running through my memory on the street of dreams  
On the streets of dreams  
  
I know you will always be on the street of dreams  
Will we ever meet again, my friend, on the street of dreams?  
Do you know just what it means to be on the street of dreams?

Then I awoke  
Was this some kind of joke  
Much to my surprise  
When I opened my eyes.  
  
We heard the trumpets blow and the sky  
Turned red when I accidently said  
That I didn\'t know how I came to be here  
Not fast asleep in bed.  
I stood and held your hand.  
And nobody else\'s hand will ever do  
Nobody else\'s hand  
Then I awoke  
Was this some kind of joke  
I opened my eyes.  
Much to my surprise.

'Child on a painted horse  
Streams that will run their course  
Gone to a far away shore  
Ooh, ooh, ah  
My painted horse is weeping  
  
Days of another kind  
Frost gets a bruising vine  
Why did the carpenter die  
Ooh, ooh, ah  
My painted horse is weeping  
  
Sweet as a rose so fine  
Peaceful as a final time  
How old could the lion man cry  
Ooh, ooh, ah  
My painted horse is weeping  
  
Thoughts of a winter moon  
Warm in a distant room  
Why did I fall asleep so soon  
Ooh, ooh, ah  
My painted horse is weeping

Your servant am I  
And will humbly remain

No expertise, no self assuring smile  
No wizardry or witchcraft, no crass deceit  
No dark conspiracies, I stand on my own two feet

I ragged around the edges but I got control  
There\'s no way around it and I got control  
I reach out for my program, still got control  
Straight down to business, who needs control  
I\'ve got panache just like jack ruby  
  
I don\'t beg forgiveness, I don\'t beg at all

Right on the money just like jack ruby

I got everything I need.

That this was not my life.  
So I just phoned the airline girl  
And said, "Get me on flight number 505,  
Get me on flight number 505."  
  
Well, I confirmed my reservation.  
Then I hopped a cab.  
No idea of my destination  
And feeling pretty bad.  
  
With my suitcase in my hand.  
In my head, my new life.  
So then I told the airline girl  
"Well, get me on flight number 505,  
Get me on flight number 505."  
Alright.  
  
Well, I sat right there in my seat.  
Well, feeling like a king.  
With the whole world right at my feet.  
"Of course I\'ll have a drink!"  
  
Well, suddenly I saw  
That we never ever would arrive.  
He put the plane down in the sea.  
The end of flight number 505.  
The end of flight number 505.  
Alright.  
  
Whew, they put the plane down in the sea.  
The end of flight number 505.  
The end of flight number 505.

And all the silent whispers  
Will be blown away

Hanging on the wall  
Gold and silver for the blues

Hoping someone else will show  
  
Someone is waiting behind  
An unlocked door  
Grey circles overhead empties  
On the floor

Grown too long

'I was driving home early Sunday morning through Bakersfield  
Listening to gospel music on the colored radio station  
And the preacher said, "You know you always have the Lord by your side"  
And I was so pleased to be informed of this that I ran  
Twenty red lights in his honor  
Thank you Jesus, thank you Lord  
  
I had an arrangement to meet a girl, and I was kind of late  
And I thought by the time I got there she\'d be off  
She\'d be off with the nearest truck driver she could find  
Much to my surprise, there she was sittin\' in the corner  
A little bleary, worse for wear and tear  
Was a girl with far away eyes  
  
So if you\'re down on your luck  
And you can\'t harmonize  
Find a girl with far away eyes  
And if you\'re downright disgusted  
And life ain\'t worth a dime  
Get a girl with far away eyes  
  
Well the preacher kept right on saying that all I had to do was send  
Ten dollars to the church of the Sacred Bleeding Heart Of Jesus  
Located somewhere in Los Angeles, California  
And next week they\'d say my prayer on the radio  
And all my dreams would come true  
So I did, the next week, I got a prayer with a girl  
Well, you know what kind of eyes she got, well I\'ll tell ya  
  
So if you\'re down on your luck  
I know you all sympathize  
Find a girl with far away eyes  
And if you\'re downright disgusted

Here she is  
And I\'ve always wanted a girl  
With a name  
A name like Mitzi Dupree  
  
She said what do you do  
I said I\'m a singer in a band  
She said ya I\'m an entertainer  
Reached out and took my hand  
She was going to a mining town  
Way up north to do her show  
I said it must be cold up there  
She said depends on who you know  
Oh that look in her eye  
I can tell you no lies  
I\'m just a man  
She made me feel like a king in my mind  
I love you Mitzi Dupree  
  
I said what is this queen of the ping pong business  
She smiled what do you think  
It has no connection with china  
I said ow have another drink  
Well I knew right away  
That I\'d seen her act before  
In a room behind a kitchen in Bangkok  
And three or four times more in Singapore  
She may not be the first  
But I know she ain\'t the worst  
She was mine but I ran out of time  
I miss you I love you Mitzi Dupree  
My darling Mitzi Dupree

When they closed up the bar, you know, they left me for dead.  
I can\'t remember a thing I said.  
Must have called the police to take me away.  
They said, "Forty days", now I\'ve got to pay.

Bout the old silver miner  
Name of hard rock Pete  
Had his house built on a slope  
They say one of his legs  
Lived in Calico  
There\'s a rumor going round  
That the other lived in hope  
So I walked in the room  
And I stopped  
I turned around  
And looked over my shoulder  
And a voice close beside me said  
You\'d better watch your head  
The party\'s over  
  
It wasn\'t long before  
The waitress came over and said  
Can I freshen up your drink  
And have you heard of these boys  
And if you feel included  
To buy some cowboy boots  
Well it\'s not that bad  
We can talk above the noise\'  
So I sucked on my beer  
Shut my eyes  
And tried to listen to the words  
I know I missed the meaning  
But the message  
Was something I\'d already heard  
  
Johnny Ringo\'s voice  
Is getting deeper  
And now he\'s going to put  
Another lock on the door  
The night is getting later  
My head is getting lighter  
The mood is getting darker  
Tequila\'s being poured  
So I smile  
At the old gunslinger  
In his frame on the wall  
As he pushed back his hat  
And it\'s all coming back  
I\'d cut a long story short  
But it\'s much too late for that  
  
Somebody stole my guitar  
They took it from  
The back seat of my car  
  
I was sleeping in Memphis  
In my hotel room  
And somebody stole my guitar

When the lights go down, and you hit the ground  
It\'ll happen so fast,....

'I see reflections in the water  
Autumn colours, summer\'s daughter  
And as as the year is growing older  
I see winter on my shoulder  
I stand in the haze  
Watching stormy ripples grow on my own  
Never knew your needed  
Till I found myself standing here alone  
  
And in the water, such a sad face  
Slowly drowning, such a sad face  
If only I could change the seasons  
Like a poet, I\'ve my reasons  
It started to snow in the middle of July  
Wonder why  
Never did understand you  
My sorrow is hanging in the grey sky  
  
In the summer days we flew to the sun  
On melting wings  
But the seasons changed to fast  
Leave us all behind  
Blind  
  
But then the stone fell on the water  
Putting end to summer\'s daughter  
And me, I turn away remembering  
All the seasons, such a sad thing  
It started to rain in the middle of the sun  
Winter\'s begun  
  
Never did understand you  
My sorrow is hanging in the grey sky  
  
In the summer days we flew to the sun  
On melting wings  
But the seasons changed to fast  
Leave us all behind  
Blind

'I get lost on a regular basis  
I\'m not alone I see the same old faces  
Back on the road it\'s a worthy opponent  
I get home in the heat of the moment  
  
What\'s that stuff always rise to the surface  
College cream, it always emerges  
Be what you are I tell myself  
And myself tells me we can\'t be anybody else  
  
You always sleep with a smile on your face  
Much as I want to put myself in your place  
Not my business I\'ve got dreams of my own  
I try to recall but when I wake up it\'s gone  
  
Don\'t let go of that image  
You\'ll never see it again  
  
I can hear voices they\'re buzzing in my head  
Eyebrows raised was it something I said  
A long hot night, it crept in like a thief  
The engine stopped, the seat belt popped  
And her jaw dropped in disbelief  
  
Don\'t let go of that beast  
You\'ll never see it again  
  
Don\'t let go of that whiskey bottle  
You\'ll never see it again

'Once upon a time you dressed so fine  
You threw the bums a dime in your prime,

Bound to fall"  
You thought they were all kiddin\' you  
  
You used to laugh about  
Everybody that was hangin\' out  
Now you don\'t walk so proud  
Now you don\'t talk so loud  
About having to be scrounging for your  
Next meal  
  
How does it feel  
How does it feel  
To be on your own  
With no direction home  
A complete unknown  
Just like a rolling stone?  
  
You\'ve went to the finest school all right,  
Miss Lonely  
But you know you only used to get juiced  
In it  
Nobody has ever taught you how to  
Live on the street  
But now you find out you\'re gonna have  
To get used to it  
You said you\'d never compromise  
With the mystery tramp, but now you  
Realize  
That he\'s not selling any alibis  
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes  
And say do you want to make a deal?  
  
How does it feel  
How does it feel  
To be on your own  
With no direction home  
Like a complete unknown  
Just like a rolling stone?

Princess on the steeple and all the pretty  
People  
They\'re drinkin\', thinkin\' that they got it  
Made  
Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and  
Things  
You\'d better take your diamond ring,  
You\'d better pawn it babe  
You used to be so amused  
At Napoleon in rags with the language that  
He used  
Go to him now, he calls you, you can\'t  
Refuse  
When you got nothing, you got nothing to  
Lose  
You\'re invisible now, you got no secrets to  
Conceal  
  
How does it feel  
How does it feel  
To be on your own  
With no direction home  
Like a complete unknown  
Just like a rolling stone?

A thousand warriors I have known  
And laughing as the spirits appear  
All your life  
Shadows of another day

We must remain  
Perfect strangers  
  
I know I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow  
  
A strand of silver hanging through the sky  
Touching more than you see  
The voice of ages in your mind  
Is aching with the dead of the night  
Precious life (your tears are lost in  
Falling rain)

Perfect strangers

Someone murdering my sisters and brothers  
In the name of some god or another

For the first precious few it\'s time to go  
What might have been we\'ll never know

Oh yes, we\'ve forgotten what we\'re looking for

Leave it all behind you won\'t need any of those things

To give me a line

Passing your time with a holy man  
Talking about the moon and sun

Between the fool and wise  
Show me a river to follow  
Away from all these lies

Won\'t you lend me your hand  
I\'ve been picking up my bones too long  
Won\'t you understand  
  
Called to the captain  
To put me ashore  
For it looked like no man\'s land  
Is this the way to follow

He told me had no answer  
He didn\'t really hold the key  
I am a simple man  
Was all he said to me  
  
I\'ve been on my own so long  
Won\'t you lend me a hand

She was calling out my name  
Whisper in the dark night  
Saying who\'s to blame

We spent a lonely night at the Memory Motel  
It\'s on the ocean I guess you know it well  
It took a starry night to steal my breath away  
Down on the waterfront her hair all drenched  
In spray  
  
Hannah baby was a honey of a girl  
Her eyes were hazel her teeth were slightly curved  
She took my guitar and she began to play  
She sang a song to me, stuck right in my brain  
You\'re just a memory of a love that used to be  
You\'re just a memory of a love that used to mean so  
Much to me  
  
She got a mind of her own and she use it well, yeah  
Well she\'s one of a kind  
Got a mind  
She got a mind of her own, yeah, and she use it mighty fine  
  
She drove a pick-up truck painted green and blue  
The tires were wearing thin she done a mile or two  
And when I asked her where she headed for  
(Back up to Boston I\'m singing in a bar)  
I got to fly today on down to Baton Rouge  
My nerves are shot already the road ain\'t all that smooth  
  
Across in Texas is the rose of San Antone  
I keep on a feeling that gnawing in my bones

Much to me  
(just a memory)  
You\'re just a memory of a love that used to mean so

We been ten thousand miles and been in fifteen states  
Every woman seemed to fade out of my mind  
I hit the bottle and I hit the sack and cried  
What\'s all this laughter on the twenty-second floor?  
It\'s just some friends of mine and they\'re busting  
Down the doors

Not tearing us apart

Oh you gonna lose it  
  
Back to back  
One on one  
Shake it up  
Move it on  
Back to back  
One on one  
Turn it up  
Hold it down

'Well I\'m standing here on moving station  
All the world is traveling by  
To strange outlandish destinations  
There they go, I wonder why  
  
I may be crazy  
But I\'m no stupid  
I get along  
I use my silver tongue  
  
You know I can dream in any language  
Flying on my magic bed  
And I don\'t need to work my passage  
All I do is use my head  
  
I may be crazy  
But I\'m no stupid  
Sometimes I ramble  
Then I\'m Lucid  
I might seem lazy  
But I\'m hurting no-one  
I get along  
I use my silver tongue  
  
I know exactly what you\'re thinking  
But you don\'t know what\'s in my mind  
You went too fast and now your sinking  
Because you forgot to read the signs
